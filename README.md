# OctopusGraphQL
IOG_CD.py is code to download Intelligent Octopus Go (IOG) completedDispatches and save to a logfile.  
You'll need to edit it with your Octopus account number and api key, and to select logfile location.
(I think I may have based it on code I found elsewhere, so apologies if you recognise it! Let me know and I'll credit you)
